# Reinforcement Learning Notes

This repository contains the LaTeX notes written by me during my self study of Reinforcement Learning.

Currently, this repo contains, the notes for 2015 lectures of Reinforcement Lerning given by Prof. David Silver. The plan is to extend this and add lectured from the Foundations of Deep RL.
